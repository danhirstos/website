            desc: "Our research proposes using a mobile app to help children in South Africa complete their TB treatment and have a better experience with it.",
            long_desc: "Children with TB and their caregivers are aware of the importance of treatment, but TB treatment for children is often difficult, with drugs that have an unpleasant taste and serious side effects. As a result, many children fail to complete their full treatment, despite their initial motivation, and face the risk of developing drug resistant TB or even death. In this article, we suggest using a mobile app to enhance children’s experience of and adherence to TB treatment in South Africa. Our app features an avatar, rewards, and social support to address common challenges in TB treatment and improve the well-being of children and their caregivers throughout the treatment process."

            desc: "Our study found that self-reflection may help older adults have better memory and brain health, potentially protecting them from dementia.",
            long_desc: "Dementia is a devastating disease that affects over 50 million people worldwide. However, up to one third of cases can be prevented by addressing modifiable lifestyle risk factors, such as poor diet and lack of physical activity. Psychological factors that may increase dementia risk have received less attention. This study examined one of them: self-reflection, which involves actively assessing one’s own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We found that older adults who engaged in more self-reflection had better memory performance and higher glucose metabolism. These factors are both protective against Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia."

            long_desc: "An HPV based screen-and-treat approach with ablative therapy can prevent cervical cancer. Patients who test positive for HPV, the cause of cervical cancer, can receive ablative therapy treatment at a clinic on the same day. The WHO recommends this approach, but ablative therapy is new and its effects on patients are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to understand whether patients found this HPV screening followed by ablative therapy acceptable and feasible. We found that, although patients experienced minor side effects from the treatment, they expressed satisfaction and relief, and wanted this approach to be available at more clinics."
